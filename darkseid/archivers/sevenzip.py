"""7-Zip archiver implementation using py7zr library.

This module provides 7-Zip archive support for the darkseid archiver system.
It implements the Archiver abstract base class to provide consistent interface
for 7-Zip archive operations.

Requirements:
    py7zr < 1.0.0

Examples:
    Basic usage:

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from darkseid.archivers.sevenzip import SevenZipArchiver
    >>>
    >>> # Create a new 7z archive
    >>> with SevenZipArchiver(Path("example.cb7")) as archive:
    ...     archive.write_file("hello.txt", "Hello, World!")
    ...     archive.write_file("page1.jpg", b'bogus image')
    ...
    ...     # Read files from the archive
    ...     content = archive.read_file("hello.txt")
    ...     print(content.decode())  # Output: Hello, World!
    ...
    ...     # List all files
    ...     files = archive.get_filename_list()
    ...     print(files)  # Output: ['hello.txt', 'data.json']

    Reading existing archives:

    >>> with SevenZipArchiver(Path("existing.cb7")) as archive:
    ...     if archive.exists("config.txt"):
    ...         config = archive.read_file("config.txt").decode()
    ...         print(f"Config: {config}")

class SevenZipArchiver(Archiver):
    """7-Zip archiver implementation using py7zr library.

    This class provides comprehensive 7-Zip archive support following the Archiver interface.
    It handles reading, writing, and management of 7-Zip archives (.cb7) using the
    py7zr library with efficient caching and batch operations.

    Features:
        - Full read/write support for 7-Zip archives
        - LZMA compression for optimal file size reduction
        - Intelligent file caching for improved performance
        - Batch operations for multiple files
        - Memory-efficient streaming operations
        - Context manager support for proper resource cleanup
        - Automatic parent directory creation

    Limitations:
        - Requires py7zr < 1.0.0 to be installed
        - Write operations require full archive reconstruction
        - No password protection support
        - Some advanced 7-Zip features may not be available
        - Performance may be slower than native 7-Zip for very large archives

    Performance Notes:
        - Files are cached in memory after first read for faster subsequent access
        - Filename lists are cached to avoid repeated archive parsing
        - Write operations rewrite the entire archive (7-Zip format limitation)
        - Use batch operations (write_files, remove_files) when possible

    Thread Safety:
        This class is NOT thread-safe. Use separate instances for concurrent access
        or implement external synchronization.

    Error Handling:
        All operations can raise ArchiverReadError or ArchiverWriteError exceptions.
        The class includes comprehensive error handling and logging for troubleshooting.

    Examples:
        Creating and writing to a 7z archive:

        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> from darkseid.archivers.sevenzip import SevenZipArchiver
        >>>
        >>> # Create new archive and add files
        >>> archive = SevenZipArchiver(Path("comic.cb7"))
        >>> with archive:
        ...     # Add text file
        ...     archive.write_file("metadata.txt", "Comic metadata here")
        ...
        ...     # Add binary file (e.g., image)
        ...     with open("page1.jpg", "rb") as f:
        ...         archive.write_file("pages/page1.jpg", f.read())
        ...
        ...     # Verify files were added
        ...     files = archive.get_filename_list()
        ...     print(f"Archive contains: {files}")

        Reading from an existing 7z archive:

        >>> # Read from existing archive
        >>> with SevenZipArchiver(Path("existing.cb7")) as archive:
        ...     # Check if archive is valid
        ...     if archive.test():
        ...         # List all files
        ...         files = archive.get_filename_list()
        ...         print(f"Found {len(files)} files")
        ...
        ...         # Read specific file
        ...         if "metadata.txt" in files:
        ...             content = archive.read_file("metadata.txt")
        ...             print(f"Metadata: {content.decode()}")
        ...
        ...         # Process all files
        ...         for filename in files:
        ...             if filename.endswith('.jpg'):
        ...                 image_data = archive.read_file(filename)
        ...                 print(f"Image {filename}: {len(image_data)} bytes")

        Batch operations for better performance:

        >>> with SevenZipArchiver(Path("batch.cb7")) as archive:
        ...     # Remove multiple files at once
        ...     files_to_remove = ["temp1.txt", "temp2.txt", "old_data.json"]
        ...     success = archive.remove_files(files_to_remove)
        ...
        ...     if success:
        ...         print("Batch removal successful")
        ...     else:
        ...         print("Some files could not be removed")

        Error handling:

        >>> from darkseid.archivers import ArchiverReadError, ArchiverWriteError
        >>>
        >>> try:
